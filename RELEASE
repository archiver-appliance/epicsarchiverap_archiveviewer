Paul Chu:
- Excluded unused code from the application jar,
  reducing archiveviewer.jar from 15MB to only 5MB.

Kay Kasemir:
- Modified build.xml to generate 'archiveviewer' script with
  default URL 'ics-srv-web2.sns.ornl.gov' instead of 'archive1'.
- Patched epics/archiveviewer/clients/channelarchiver/ArchiverClient.java
  to avoid overrun in nanosecond computation.
  Viewer used to request start/end times with nonsensical nanoseconds,
  which crashed the old data server when built with EPICS base R3.14.8.
